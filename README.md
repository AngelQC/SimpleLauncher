# Simple Launcher
In your tray, like I used to do in Windows prior to version 11!

## Todo: ##
* Properly rename the content
* Rewrite the content of this readme
* Translate interface to French (work environment is french.. so let's try to accomodate)
  * Add support for multi language, instead, if possible quickly.
* Up the framework version support to whatever is mainstream here at the office.

## Also, first ever project in git/hub/lab/whatever, I don't know what I'm doing :-D
